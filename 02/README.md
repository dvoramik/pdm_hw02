## Installation
Report is in form of an [IPython notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html).
In order to install it and run it you can run following commands. I am assuming you are working on linux and have Python 3.7 installed.

```
python3.7 -m venv __venv__
. __venv__/bin/activate
pip install notebook pandas matplotlib plotly numpy sklearn
python -m notebook
```

First command will create a virtual environment for Python and second command will activate the environment.
Pip install command will install dependencies and IPython notebook.
The last command will open IPython notebook in a web browser.
